# "parcel()" Control Flow Structure

> This is the `parcel()` commands control flow structure. The layout of the path that any file or folder passed in will take. I originally wrote this so I wouldn't personally get lost in my own code as I was writing it and figured it might help someone else as well. Allthough roughly written, the followwing chart does represent the actual parcel function exactly, so it is a reliable road map of the source.
